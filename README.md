# Fibonacci

The Fibonacci number Fn for n>0 is defined as follows:

 F1 = 1
 F2 = 1
 Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2 for n>2.

The quotient Fn by Fn-1 converges to the golden number, that is, Fn/Fn-1=1,618.... Write a program that, given n>0, calculates Fn.

    Version 1: iterative function.
    Version 2: recursive function. The recursive version has a rather explosive nature.
